# Codeforces Solutions Repository 🚀

Welcome to my Codeforces solutions repository! Here, you'll find my journey through the exciting world of competitive programming. The repository is organized by contest number, problem index, and the problem name (e.g., '1A - Theatre Square').

## About This Repository

This repository is a collection of my solutions to Codeforces problems, showcasing my progress as a competitive programmer. As a newbie, you'll find here my initial attempts, complete with errors and inefficiencies. But fear not! If you're also new to this, you can learn from my mistakes. And if you're an experienced programmer, your insights and suggestions to improve my code are most welcome!

## Keeping the Repository Up-to-date

I'm constantly challenging myself to solve more problems and enhance my skills. That means I'll be regularly updating this repository with new solutions as I progress. Additionally, I intend to revisit and update the old solutions as I learn new techniques (though, let's be honest, this may not always happen!). I also plan to include helpful resources for each topic, making this repository a valuable reference for both you and me.

## Language Usage

For the majority of problems, I'll be using C++ as my primary language. However, I'm also keen on exploring Rust, so you may find some solutions implemented in Rust too. To identify the language used in each file, just look at the file extension - `.cpp` for C++, `.c` for C, and `.rs` for Rust.

## Contribution

I'm truly grateful for anyone who finds interest in this repository and takes the time to explore my solutions. If you have suggestions, improvements, or alternative solutions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can make this repository a fantastic resource for the competitive programming community!

Thank you for visiting, and I hope to keep this repository alive and thriving for as long as possible! 🌟
