# Codeforces

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

They are ordered by the contest number and the problem index (Ex: '1A' is the first problem of the first contest) and the name of the problem. (Ex: '1A - Theatre Square') 

## They are all my solution to each problem with the errors and inefficiency of a newbie into competitive programming. So, if you are a newbie too, you can learn from my mistakes and if you are an experienced programmer, you can help me improve my code. This repository was meant to be a way for me to track my progress and keep a record of my development as a programmer.

## I will be constantly updating this repository with new solutions as I solve more problems, and I will be updating the old solutions as I learn new things (Probably I would not do this, but that's my intention at the moment). I also would try to include resources that help me get deeper into each topic, so this would be as useful to me as it is to you.

## I will be using C++ as my main language, but I mean to use rust for some as it is the language I work with.
## You can check the language just looking at the extension of the file, mostly .cpp for c++ /.c for c and / .rs for rust.


## Thanks for reading and I hope to keep this repository alive as long as I can.
